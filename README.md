#Ceasars Cipher
##Project 03 FreeCodeCamp(FCC) JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification
The goal was to create a tool to decipher any text using Ceasars Cipher (for English alphabet).

Conditions as stated by FCC:
A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.
Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.
All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.
